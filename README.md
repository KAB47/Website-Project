# Website-Project
A website for a restaurant that uses a simple booking system.

This project consists of a set of static HTML files that form a simple website. It includes pages like "Index," "Contact," "Book," and "Restaurants" which you can explore in your browser.

The "Book" page uses a booking system to schedule a dining date.
